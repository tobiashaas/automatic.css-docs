## Functions

- Background classes allow you to change the background color on-the-fly, whether it’s a section, container, div, or any other boxed element.

While there are dozens of classes to choose from, they all follow the same conventions. If you remember the convention, you’ll be able to recall any color, shade, or transparency without having to look at the documentation.

## Mixins

If you want to set the background color to one of the main ACSS colors, use:

```CSS
.bg--[color]
```
